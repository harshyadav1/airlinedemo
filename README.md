## Description

A beautiful React Redux application that lets you display two-way flight datas of any given dates with the ability to filter by price and by duration.

- The flight datas are fetched from Lufthansa's API, only price and airline names are randomly generated because the API doesn't contain them.
- In order to use the API, you need to generate API access token. And in order to generate this token, you have to sign up to [Lufthansa's developer website](https://developer.lufthansa.com/member/register "Lufthansa's developer website") only then you can use your provided application code and secret key to generate a token.
- Tokens have an expiration date but you can also generate token by providing the above mentioned informations within another API call.

**Note:** Please blame 'Prettier' code formatter for absurd looking code formatting. It is pretty handy most of the time but even though JSX options are enabled in the config, it acts really weird while formatting it.

## Token may expire after sometime use Lufthansa's developer website for generating it meanwhile i am using the token generarted by me for accessing the API

## Appilcation is accesasible under the port : http://localhost:8080/
